### Abstract of the thesis
The objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the Air Pollution Prevention and Control Action Plan implemented in China from 2013 to 2017. Specifically, it investigates the relationship between the different levels of intensity of the measures enforced in two different groups of regions and the reduction of air pollution concentrations in these two groups using a differences-in-differences model. Our result shows that the more intense measures in key regions are more beneficial to alleviate the particulate matter (PM10) concentration compared to the less intense measures in other regions. However, this difference in intensity did not produce a difference in effectiveness in case of reducing nitrogen oxides (NOx) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) concentration.
